How to connect Python to MySQL DB:

Copy Paste this into your windows cmd and then run each command
	
	# For mysql-connector-python
	pip install mysql-connector-python

	# For PyMySQL
	pip install pymysql

After this you want to use your preferred IDE (I use Jupyter notebook) to code for the connection:

	import mysql.connector

	# Establish a connection
	conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    		host="localhost",      # Replace with your host which in my case is localhost since I run MySQL on my laptop
    		user="your_username",  # Replace with your username
   	 	password="your_password",  # Replace with your password 
    		database="your_database"   # Replace with your database name
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = conn.cursor()

print("Connected to MySQL database!")
